        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        <p>
          As a new media artist, I explore cultural differences and personal
          experiences through technology. I construct spaces mixing reality and
          virtuality where emotions and feelings are expressed by digital
          mediums allowing the audience to become both the observer and
          performer. I created my work mainly in forms of interactive
          installations, and 3D animations. My inspiration comes from the
          experience of growing up in China and living in America for many
          years. The study of digital culture and technology over the years
          makes them a part of my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my previous works, “One.” was about my feelings about China’s One
          Child Policy and its massive impact on the people over the course of
          35 years. In “Paper Plane”, I was experimenting with the experiences
          living in both China and the United States for over 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work is inspired by my experiences in life and influenced by the
          cultural differences between China and the US. I concentrate on the
          emotions, sensations and reactions towards the issues and reassembled
          them into a visualized form. I am also interested in how political
          issues impact art or vice versa. By experimenting with technology, I
          am creating/recreating narratives, connections and representing
          information.
